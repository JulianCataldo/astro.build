Bird biscuit meme

It‚Äôs easy to see proper tooling set up as a chore. It kills all the fun when you just want to dive into coding!

To be fair, years ago, it took ages to bootstrap an optimized web dev. project. But fortunately, that‚Äôs a thing of the past.

For those not familiar with the term, tooling is everything that:

- Transpiles.
- Acts as superset convenience languages.
- Performs static analysis.
- Auto-polyfills.

Although not strictly _needed_ in order to code, it‚Äôs worth the learning curve when you get so many benefits:

- Ensuring **conventions**.
- **Automating repetitive tasks**.
- Giving useful **insights**.

This topic is so near and dear to me, that I‚Äôve built an entire [Web Garden](https://code.juliancataldo.com/) for sharing tooling configs and web design patterns. Here are some of my top recommended tools to take your Astro DX to the next level!

ESLint preview

For linting, you can count on astro-eslint-parser + Yosuke Ota‚Äôs amazing eslint-plugin-astro.

THIS NEEDS A FILE TITLE SO PEOPLE KNOW WHERE TO TYPE THIS

    module.exports = {
      overrides: [
        {
          files: ['*.astro'],
          extends: [
            //
            'airbnb-base',
            'plugin:astro/recommended',
            'prettier',
          ],
          parser: 'astro-eslint-parser',
          parserOptions: {
            parser: '@typescript-eslint/parser',
            extraFileExtensions: ['.astro'],
          },
        },

You will also need to configure the Code extension to hook up with Astro files.

    {

      "eslint.validate": [
        "javascript",

Use [`prettier-plugin-astro`](https://github.com/withastro/prettier-plugin-astro) to add Prettier support for your `.astro` files.

    }

## [](#Ensure-formatting-conventions-with-Editorconfig 'Ensure-formatting-conventions-with-Editorconfig')Ensure formatting conventions with Editorconfig

Editorconfig is a standardized way of conveying formatting preferences to your IDE recognized by a wide range of tools (JetBrains, Code, GitHub‚Ä¶) and integrates nicely with Prettier

Once you know about it, you can‚Äôt live without it. It might just become the first dot-file you add to a fresh repo!

To get started, create the following file in your workspace root:  
NAME THE FILE

    touch .editorconfig

DOES THIS GO IN THE SAME FILE? WHERE SHOULD THIS BE ADDED?

This is an example baseline that allows you to specify your desired indentation, line breaks and more:

    [*]
    indent_style = tab
    indent_size = 2
    end_of_line = lf
    charset = utf-8
    trim_trailing_whitespace = false
    insert_final_newline = true

    [*.md]
    trim_trailing_whitespace = false

    [*.yaml]
    indent_style = space

No more overwhelming 8-spaces indentation on GitHub!

Pro tip: `trim_trailing_whitespace` is useful to keep the double ‚Äú‚Äù for End-Of-Lines instead of using ‚Äú‚Äù to force a carriage return.

## [](#Leverage-first-class-Astro-support-for-TypeScript 'Leverage-first-class-Astro-support-for-TypeScript')Leverage first-class Astro support for TypeScript

TypeScript support in Astro is first-class, and getting better all the time! There is no need to install anything ‚Äì it‚Äôs built-right in.

Set TypeScript to `strictest` in your `tsconfig.json` and call the CLI type-checker `astro-check` for the tightest type-safety around.

## [](#Remove-wrinkles-from-your-sheets-using-Stylelint 'Remove-wrinkles-from-your-sheets-using-Stylelint')Remove wrinkles from your sheets using Stylelint

Stylelint is a mighty CSS linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions.

Even if you use Tailwind, you‚Äôll occasionally use some third-party CSS, target externally loaded markup, or throw some handy rules in your scoped Astro components.

`stylelint-config-html` is a special Stylelint configuration for handling many flavors of embedded, HTML-like syntax (HTML, XML, Vue, Svelte, Astro, and even PHP!).

Try these configs in your Astro project:

    'stylelint-config-standard',
    'stylelint-config-standard-scss',
    'stylelint-config-prettier',
    'stylelint-config-recess-order',
    'stylelint-config-html/astro',
    'stylelint-config-tailwindcss/scss',

The Tailwind config makes @apply rules play nicely with SCSS, while Recess ordering organizes your stylesheets, making code much more scannable.

# [](#Catch-problems-before-committing-with-lint-staged 'Catch-problems-before-committing-with-lint-staged')Catch problems before committing with lint-staged

Use `lint-stage` for linting exactly when and where you need it. It will run a lint process right before committing your code, and only on the files to be committed.

IMAGE: okonet / lint-staged

It can also be (unofficially) configured to run as a pre-commit hook, like [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

    # yaml-language-server: $schema=https://json.schemastore.org/lintstagedrc.schema.json

    '*.{ts,js,cjs,mts,mjs,cts,jsx,tsx,astro,vue}':
      - eslint --fix

    '*.{scss,css,astro,vue}':
      - stylelint --fix

    '*.{ts,js,cjs,mts,mjs,json,yaml,cts,jsx,tsx,astro,md,vue}':
      - prettier -w

[See this configuration file in my Web Garden](https://github.com/JulianCataldo/web-garden/blob/develop/configs/.lintstagedrc-example.yaml)

## [](#Move-at-light-speed-with-Tailwind-CSS-and-the-Flowbite-design-system 'Move-at-light-speed-with-Tailwind-CSS-and-the-Flowbite-design-system')Move at light speed with Tailwind CSS and the Flowbite design system

Formatting, linting, and TypeScript all are all cool tools for safer, easier and faster building with Astro.

Now, let‚Äôs talk design . . .

The official Astro Tailwind integration lets you style your site quickly, and [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com) allows you to build websites even faster with components on top of Tailwind CSS. It is an agnostic, non-opinionated option that integrates well with Astro‚Äôs Tailwind integration.

I personally got tired of fighting with projects that include:

- Multiple Material UI releases
- Over-engineered CSS-in-JS frameworks
- Random inline CSS bits  
  . . . And all sorts of clever wizardry, sometimes several different design systems and methods combined!

With Tailwind, I can just drop a `.css` file into my project. And, using a focused UI kit like Flowbite saves me on bundle size by constraining variations.

\[Bundle size example\]

Using Flowbite in Astro was such a great experienced for me, I built an open-source UI admin dashboard template that uses Flowbite components. You can check out the project‚Äôs [Tailwind configuration file](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-astro-admin-dashboard/blob/main/tailwind.config.cjs) to see how to integrate Flowbite into your Astro Tailwind project.

If you need a dashboard theme, or just want to see how Flowbite works in Astro, you can visit [the Flowbite Astro Admin Dashboard repo on GitHub](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-astro-admin-dashboard). This repo takes advantage of all of the tools mentioned above, and takes Astro DX to the moon! ![:rocket:](https://assets.hackmd.io/build/emojify.js/dist/images/basic/rocket.png)

Remember: tooling exists to help you think less, not to get in your way!

Explore these tools and configuration for inspiration and time-saving / life-enhancing tricks, and then adjust them to suit your own workflow.

You can find all aforementioned configurations in use in my latest OSS template Flowbite Astro Admin Dashboard.
